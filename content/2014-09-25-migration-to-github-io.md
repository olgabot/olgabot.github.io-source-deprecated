Summary: Migrated my blog from Tumblr to Github.io

I moved my blog from [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for several reasons:

1. Write posts in Markdown and IPython notebooks so figures, code, and LaTeX markup would show up fine.
2. Easily back up my posts. Before, I wrote my posts in [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/) and then copy-pasted to Tumblr, but I didn't like that.
3. I don't use the re-blogging or following aspects of Tumblr much so I didn't see the advantages of that network.
4. Awesome [customizable themes](http://www.pelicanthemes.com/) using Pelican.

There are a few drawbacks, most notably, the comments from previous posts are still tied to the Tumblr website, because Tumblr doesn't use slugs (e.g. "`migration-to-github-io`") for its webpage names, instead it uses some random number generator for keeping track of posts, e.g "post/72680703972". And because [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) uses the URL from the post to map it back to its database, and I couldn't get the original mapping :( So comments for old posts will be back on Tumblr.

I'm excited for a new start with blogging!
