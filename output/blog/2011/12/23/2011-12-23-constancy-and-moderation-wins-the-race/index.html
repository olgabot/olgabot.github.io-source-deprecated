But besides advice for the ivory tower, this book has great&nbsp;<em>life</em>&nbsp;advice. This guy is a psychologist and spent years studying exemplary new faculty and what sets them apart. The book emphasizes &#8220;<strong>constancy and moderation</strong>,&#8221; essentially &#8220;slow and steady wins the&nbsp;race.&#8221;</p>  <p class="p3">The originator of &#8220;slow and steady wins the race&#8221; is Aesop&#8217;s fable &#8220;The Tortoise and the Hare.&#8221; The Tortoise puts in steady work, constantly working a little bit towards the goal. The Hare, on the other hand, procrastinates until the last minute and is forced to sprint to a low-quality product&mdash;losing the race when the Hare is clearly the faster&nbsp;runner.</p>  <p class="p3">Like many of us, I sympathize with the hare. When faced with a new project I think to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m smart. I could finish this in a night.&#8221; I procrastinate until a few days before, then rush to get everything done, realizing the project was much bigger than I thought, and I end up with a B- on something I could have earned&nbsp;A+.</p>  <p class="p3">As a nerd, I love data and graphs and what struck me about <span class="s2">Advice for New Faculty</span> were the charts of input and output of &#8220;exemplary quick-starting&#8221; new faculty and their less exemplary peers, shown in <em>Figure 15.2</em>&nbsp;below. The &#8220;quick-starting&#8221; faculty (labeled <em>Moderates</em>) worked consistently on writing throughout the week and produced many more pages of writing per week than their peers (labeled <em>Romantics</em>). These less productive faculty romanticized the impulsiveness of binges, ie misguided statements such as &#8220;True genius is inspired,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I have to wait until the perfect moment to work,&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s what divine madness&nbsp;means.&#8221;</p>  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/jBpddgyDFGmvisEJuGiICxzhBnAwpCDcGhbrFwfbhDgDsJbtCtgrADEobByc/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_18.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"><img alt="Photo_dec_21_17_19_18" height="460" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/jBpddgyDFGmvisEJuGiICxzhBnAwpCDcGhbrFwfbhDgDsJbtCtgrADEobByc/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_18.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /></a> </div> <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/eskncBeJjczGgongeHyuItpFFmvDzHxdChvroFhaCpfIchkkmAxymrDDCqEv/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_38.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"><img alt="Photo_dec_21_17_19_38" height="427" src="http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/eskncBeJjczGgongeHyuItpFFmvDzHxdChvroFhaCpfIchkkmAxymrDDCqEv/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_38.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /></a> </div>   <p class="p3">How does this affect me, and more importantly, you? Boice suggests tackling difficult tasks such as writing in&nbsp;<em>brief, daily sessions</em> (BDSs) lasting as few as 15 minutes and as many as 90 minutes. <strong>Why brief?</strong>&nbsp;Brevity is essential as you work while you are fresh and able, not until you&#8217;re exhausted (see:&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/glamorized-exhaustion-is-not-productivity"><span class="s3">glamorized exhaustion</span></a>).&nbsp;<strong>Why daily?</strong>&nbsp;By working on your projects daily, you keep them fresh in your mind and which allows connections to appear, almost&nbsp;effortlessly.</p>  <p class="p3">But BDSs apply to more than just writing. They are perfect for your most paralyzing activity, the activity&nbsp;or task you know you have to do but you can&#8217;t seem to muster the motivation.&nbsp;Ask yourself:&nbsp;<strong>what is my most paralyzing activity?</strong>&nbsp;For computer scientists, it could be the [intolerable] biology class. For biologists, it could be the dreaded calculus homework. It could be learning a new programming language, writing your thesis, exercising, or mastering an instrument. For me, it&#8217;s PhD and fellowship&nbsp;applications.</p>  <p class="p3">Next, <strong>schedule this activity at your peak time</strong>. For many people (including myself), this is first thing in the morning. Before you check your email or read your blogs. It doesn&#8217;t have to be for very long, even a focused 15-minute push can greatly advance a project. If you&#8217;re deeper into the project, you could go for as long as 90 minutes. By the time the rest of the world wakes up, you&#8217;ll have accomplished your hardest&nbsp;task.</p>  <p class="p3">Lastly, <strong>begin before feeling ready. </strong>Before you get that surge of inspiration you&#8217;re waiting for, start putting words or code or brushstrokes down. The inspiration will come as you work. More on this in future&nbsp;posts.</p>  <p class="p3">For example, last quarter I had 5 fellowship applications and 7 PhD school applications to submit with deadlines of November 1st, November 18th, and December 1st. Doesn&#8217;t sound so bad until you see how much writing you have to do. 2000 words for one fellowship, 5000 characters for another.&nbsp;<strong>The amount of writing paralyzed me</strong>.&nbsp;Of course, I could use materials from finished apps, but first I had to <em>finish</em>&nbsp;them. Over October and November, I worked on my applications every day in the morning. <strong>It was incredibly liberating to know that my paralyzing work was&nbsp;underway.</strong></p>  <p class="p3"><strong>You can do this.</strong>&nbsp;Comment or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:olga@olgabotvinnik.com"><span class="s3">send me an email</span></a>&nbsp;about what is your most paralyzing activity, and how you&#8217;re going to fight/combat its influence over&nbsp;you.</p>  </p></div>
